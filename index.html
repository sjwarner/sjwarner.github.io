  <h2>Hi, I'm Sam!</h2>

  <p>I am a computer science graduate, a full time software developer and
  extremely passionate about volunteering and helping young students
  to establish and achieve their goals.</p>

  <p>Right now I help make awesome technical solutions at Black Pepper
  Software. Further to that I am enjoying living life to the fullest by
  going out, enjoying my free time, and helping out in my local area.</p>

  <p>Starting work and standing on my own two feet, I realised there is
  still much I have to learn, and this is the place I'll be making my
  (infrequent) posts about learning experiences I have found valuable.
  I hope that these unstructured ramblings might help others that find
  themselves in a similar position to myself.</p>
